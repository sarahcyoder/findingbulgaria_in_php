        <p>Rugged mountains, sandy beaches, rich history, delicious cuisine, and humming cities await you, at a fraction of the price you'd pay in western Europe. Bulgaria, about the size of Tennessee, borders the Black Sea at its east and Greece to the south. I fell in love with this country for its authenticity, natural beauty, varied and delicious food, and culture.

		<h4>And I know you will too!</h4>
		<p>If you want to get off the beaten path for the trip of a lifetime, Bulgaria is your best bet. Whether you can spend a week, a month, or more, you'll be glad you chose this Balkan nation. But before you book your trip, or if you need a little more convincing, let us help!</p>
		<h2>Our Story</h2>
      	<p>I'm an American who fell in love with Bulgaria when I visited last summer with my boyfriend. He was born in Bulgaria, moved in America when he was 10, and retains ties to his home country. When we visited, I did as much research beforehand as possible, but there were fewer resources available for Bulgaria than for more popular destinations. Without my boyfriend, I would've been lost. After having a fabulous trip, I want to help other people find, and love, this beautiful country!</p>
