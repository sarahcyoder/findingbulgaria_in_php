# FindingBulgaria (.com) in PHP

This repository contains code for my site FindingBuglaria.com

I built this website for a Creating Functional Websites class project for UC Davis Extension. I have since implemented Bootstrap to make it responsive after learning about that framework and wanting to try it out for myself. Then, after taking a Server-Side Scripting with PHP class at UC Davis Extension, I added PHP includes files to remove redundant code (header, footer, and the nav) from each page.

Enjoy learning about Bulgaria - a great place to explore!
