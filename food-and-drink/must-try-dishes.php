		<h2>Must-try Dishes</h2>
		    <p>Fresh and hearty are probably the best words I have to describe Bulgarian food. You'll find similaries to both Turkish and Greek cuisine. Some of the best known dishes are the shopska salata (cucumber, tomato, and cheese salad), grilled minced meats (kufte and kebache), and stuffed grape leaves. But even after you've tried those - and you must - there is much more! Here are some of my favorites.</p>
      	<h3>Banitsa</h3>
		    <p>Good morning, indeed! A classic Bulgarian staple, banitsa comes in many varieties, and every version I've tasted has been different - and delicious! This breakfast pastry features an egg and white cheese mixture layered between sheets of phyllo dough. You can find it frozen in stores, to-go from cafes, and even homemade, if you're lucky! If you can, enjoy it with a cold ayran (a popular non-alcoholic beverage composed of yogurt, water, and a little salt).</p>

		<h3>Tsatsa</h3>
		    <p>A classic dish only found along the Black Sea, tsatsa are small fish that are fried - and eaten - whole, and usually enjoyed along with a cold beer. It's a deliciously exotic bar food and usually one of the cheapest things on the menu.</p>

		<h3>Drob Sarma</h3>
		    <p><a href="http://divaka.bg/" target="_blank">Divaka</a>, the restaurant across the street from our apartment in Sofia, made me fall in love with this dish, which consists of chopped lamb liver and rice, topped with an egg and yogurt custard. It's available at many restaurants in Bulgaria, but unfortunately I don't have a photo of this one. We always ate it too fast!</p>
