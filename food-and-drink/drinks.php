      	<h2>Drinks</h2>
		    <p>Bulgaria's beverages may be even more distinct than the foods. I was introduced to most of these drinks before going to Bulgaria, but they are still hard to find in the US, so be sure to try them while you're there!</p>

   		  <h3>Rakia</h3>
            <p>Practically the national drink, rakia is brandy made from fermented fruit. The most popular is probably grape, but I also saw plum, apricot, cherry, and apple. Its typical alcohol content is 40%, but it can be higher depending on the brand. Rakia is consumed in small quantities, usually either 50ml or 100ml, and is meant to accompany an appetizer, like a shopska salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, peppers and white cheese) or cured meats.</p>

		    <h3>Wine from the Thracian Valley</h3>
		    <p>Grapes grow throughout the country, and local Bulgarian wines are easy to find and delicious. Not to be missed!</p>

		    <h3>Ayran</h3>
		    <p>A simple drink of yogurt thinned with water, ayran is immesely popular and goes well with banitsa. Speaking of yogurt, <a href="http://www.bacillusbulgaricus.com/bulgarian-yogurt" target="_blank">Bulgarian yogurt</a> is world-class and world-famous.</p>

		    <h3>Boza</h3>
		    <p>My boyfriend had me try this, and it tasted unlike anything I have ever tried. However, all of the Bulgarians I know grew up drinking it and love it. It's probably an acquired taste, but you should buy a bottle and give it a try, just to get the full experience! While it's mostly marketed to children, the drink is actually slightly alcoholic - but only about 0.5%. It's made from boiled fermented wheat, with some sugar added.</p>
