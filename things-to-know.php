      	<h2>FOR YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
      		    <p>While I did a lot of research ahead of my first trip to Bulgaria, the books don't prepare you for everything.</p>
                <h3>Language</h3>
		        <p>While no one expects that you will learn the language, anything you can learn will earn you major bonus points. At restaurants especially, I found that Bulgarians really light up when I greet them or order food in Bulgarian. I think that they come across may tourists, often engaged in alco-tourism, who never bother to learn anything about their country. When they find someone with a genuine interest who tries just a little, they really appreciate tho effort. Words you should learn: Hello, Good Morning, Good Day, Please, Thank You, Goodnight. Here's a good place to learn basic words and phrases: <a href="http://www.101languages.net/bulgarian/basics.html">http://www.101languages.net/bulgarian/basics.html</a></p>
                
                <h3>Dress Code</h3>
      		    <p>Some of the churches require that your shoulders and thighs are covered. Since we toured Bulgaria during a heat wave with daily temperatures around 90 degrees fahrenheit, I had to plan accordingly and make sure I wore the right clothes depending on our plans. It helps to keep a scarf with you, just in case!</p> 

          		<h3>Strays</h3>
      		    <p>As we walked down the street during one of our first days in Sofia, a large unaccompanied dog trotted along past us on the street, with the air of someone who was quite busy. Another dog accompanied us on a tour we took of Plovdiv. At night, we saw a pack of dogs roaming the streets (we stayed away from them). And at an outdoor bar on the pedestrian street one evening, we pet a dog who was on his own but had clearly been groomed recently. And it's not just dogs: cats wander the streets as well, and at a few restaurants in several cities, cats begged for food. I didn't find it too alarming, and the dogs were never threatening or dangerous, but it was definitely outside my realm, and I didn't get used to it. We learned from some of the locals that there are efforts to catch and sterilize the animals, with some success.</p>
                
                <h3>Churches</h3>
      		    <p>The old and beautiful churches of Bulgaria were a highlight for me. Instead of sanctuaries full of pews or rows of seats, the churches in Bulgaria have open spaces, beautiful carvings, and beautiful frescos. In fact, the walls of the older churches are covered in paintings, many of which are hundreds of years old and very beautiful.</p>
                
                <h3>Communist-Era Buildings</h3>
      		    <p>During the Communist period, people left the country and came to cities to work. Tall, concrete &quot;panel construction&quot; apartment buildings were built to house them quickly and cheaply, and most people in Bulgaria live in those buildings. They dominate cities like Sofia and Plovdiv, and even smaller towns have them.</p>
