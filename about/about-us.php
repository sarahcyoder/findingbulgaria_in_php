   		  I'm an American who fell in love with Bulgaria when I visited last summer with my boyfriend. I didn't know what to expect, but I found a country with beautiful mountains, bustling cities, and small towns that feel older and richer than any place I have ever been. Not only that, but it's so affordable!</p>
            <p>
           I had heard a lot about Bulgaria from my boyfriend and his family, who moved to America twenty years ago, but it's easy to experience Bulgaria on your own terms. My boyfriend was born in Bulgaria but moved to America when he was 10 years old. Much of their extended family lives in Sofia, Plovdiv, and other cities throughout the country. I got to visit many of them in their homes and found that they are extremely giving and hospitable. They were all very eager to feed us!</p>
          <h3>What to Do</h3>
          <p>Before we visited, I did as much research beforehand as possible, but there were fewer resources available for Bulgaria than for more popular destinations. Without my boyfriend, I would've been lost. After having a fabulous trip, I want to help other people find, and love, this beautiful country!</p>
      	  <p>On this site, you'll find advice on how to travel to and within Bulgaria, as well as how to find the best food and how to prepare yourself for a few quirks.</p>
