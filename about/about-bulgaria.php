      	<h2>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BULGARIA</h2>
      		<p><img src="../img/plovdiv-roman-theatre.jpg" alt="Plovdiv Roman Theatre" class="img-responsive img-rounded"/>
        	    Bulgaria is a country in southeastern Europe bordered by Green to the south and the Black Sea to the east. Having been established in 681 and not changing its name since then, it is considered by some to be the oldest country in Europe (it really depends on whom you ask!). It also contains the city of Plovdiv, which, with 6,000 years of history, is believed by some to be the longest continually inhabited settlement in Europe. The above photo shows a Plovdiv Roman Theatre built 2,000 years ago that is still used today.</p>
			<h3>A (Very) Brief History</h3>
      		<p>Being so old, Bulgaria boasts a rich history. The earliest evidence of humans in present day Bulgaria are 1.4 million years old! Thracians were the first to leave a substantial mark on Bulgaria a thousand years before Christ, but the Romans left more of a mark, with ancient roads and stadiums that you can actually walk on and explore in Sofia and Plovdiv.</p>
		    <p>Bulgarian empires were followed by Ottoman rule for several hundred years. With a revival of Bulgarian culture in the 1700s and 1800s, Bulgarians began to work toward independence. After the Ottomans put down revolution attempts by the Bulgarians, help from the Russian Empire gave Bulgaria its independence in 1878.</p>
		    <p>In modern history, Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain after WW2 but was not a part of the Soviet Union. When the wall fell, Bulgaria became a parliamentary democracy. Bulgaria now part of NATO and the European Union, but it is the poorest country in the bloc.</p>
		    <h3>Culture</h3>
      		<p>Popular Bulgarian sports are wrestling, weight-lifting, and gymnastics, and of course, football (soccer) is big there. If you are lucky when you visit, you will see Bulgarians dancing, and perhaps even singing. Their folk music and traditional dances are a lot of fun to watch!</p>
