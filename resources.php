      		    <p>There are a few places where you can find good background information on Bulgaria and Bulgarian culture.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://blazingbulgaria.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Blazing Bulgaria</a></h3>
		        <p>I found the Language & Alphabet posts on this blog to be particularly helpful while learning the basics of Cyrillic, but there are more interesting posts on Bulgarian food, culture, and history. There are MANY holidays and customs associated with them, and if you're lucky, you may visit Bulgaria during a holiday. Perhaps you will even find you are visiting on your <a href="https://blazingbulgaria.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/bulgarian-names/">Name Day</a>!</p>
                
                <h3><a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/bulgaria/" target="_blank">Nomadic Matt</a></h3>
      		    <p>Matt has a well-written section on traveling through Bulgaria on his blog, and his recommendations are good. He also tells you where not to go (ie, Sunny Beach).</p> 

          		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJwad7VjIWpJX4MZbqUyrA" target="_blank">Learn Bulgarian Channel on YouTube</a></h3>
      		    <p>Bulgarians are always impressed with my pronunciation, but I owe it to this YouTube channel and their 3-minute lessons. You can learn basics (hello, good-bye, please), and I also found it helpful to know the words for food, bathroom, and "how much does this cost."</p>

	      		<p>We studied this book before and during our trip, and it's a good preparation for your trip. You'll want to carry it with you while in Bulgaria. I impressed many of our tour guides and my boyfriend's relatives with my extensive knowledge of the history and culture, but it was all thanks to this book. If you look closely at this photo (but not too closely at my outfit, please) you'll notice that I am indeed carrying my trusty tome!</p>
